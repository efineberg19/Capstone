# Plant Synthesizer Capstone Project
I have created this project to fulfill the Senior Capstone requirement for the B.S. in Computer Science and Music degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My goal is to create a synthesizer which turns plant biodata into music. 

In order to do this, I purchased and assembled a kit from [Electricity For Progress](https://electricityforprogress.com/biodata-sonification/).
Once assembled, I bought two new sensors for [Ambient Light Sensing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4162) and [Soil Moisture Sensing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026). In this repository, I have added support for these sensors and figured out how to integrate their data into the existing MIDI output.

This code is meant to run on an Adafruit ESP32 Feather S3. The kit I built this upon can be found [here](https://electricityforprogress.square.site/product/biodata-sonification-diy-kit/17?cs=true&cst=custom). The repository which I built my new functionality upon can be found [here](https://github.com/electricityforprogress/BiodataFeather).

Many thanks to Skot Wiedmann for being my project mentor as well as Samuel Cusumano [@electricityforprogress] for providing such high quality documentation and taking the time to answer all of my questions!
